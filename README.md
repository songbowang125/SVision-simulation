# SVision-simulation

This repository is for CSV simulation scripts, which are detailedly described in SVision Supplementaries. Please use run_sim_pipeline.py as your entry script.

Since these scripts are a refined version of VISOR, please refer to VISOR(https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR) for detail installation process and parameter setting.

These scripts could only simulate some certain types of complex structural variants described in SVision paper. We will no longer update these scripts for more complete functions because of the limitation of this simulation method.

We are programming a totally new tool for complex structural variant simulation, which could simulate any user-defined complex types in a model-free way. Coming soon!
